1. Readability/Clarity
Readability is the most important code quality metric as it leads to higher levels of understanding of the code among other developers. 
Your code should be easy to read and understand. Because code that's easy to read or understand is easy to improve. Proper indentation, formatting, and spacing make the code more readable. 
This also makes the code structure more consistent and visible and eases debugging process. Add comments on the code where ever required, with concise explanations for each method. 
Also, use consistent naming styles like camelCase, PascalCase, and snake_case. The code readability can also be improved by reducing the level of nesting.

2. Portability 
Portability metric measures how usable your code is in different environments. 
It shows how well other developers can use your code in other environments. You can ensure the portability of your code by regularly testing it on different platforms. 
Another best practice is to set the compiler warning levels as high as possible. Ensure to leverage two compilers. You can also improve portability by enforcing a coding standard. 

3. Reusability 
Reusability metric measures whether the existing code is reusable or repurposed for other programs or projects. 
Characteristics such as modularity or loose coupling make code easily reusable. You can measure the reusability of your code by the number of interdependencies it has. 
Interdependencies are the code elements that function properly when other elements perform properly. Conducting a static code analysis can help you find these interdependencies. 

4. Testability/ Reviews
Testability metric measures how well the code supports various testing processes conducted on it. 
It depends on your ability to control, isolate, and automate tests. You can measure the testability of your code and the number of tests it takes to identify potential faults in the code. 
The size and the complexity level of the code impact the number of tests it takes to find any errors. Therefore, it is best to test at the code level, such as cyclomatic complexity, to improve testability.


5. Maintainability
Code maintainability metric measures how easy it is to make changes to the code while keeping the risks associated with such changes as low as possible. 
It can be evaluated by the number of lines of code within the application. If these lines are more than the average number, then the maintainability is inferred to be low. 



6. Efficiency 
The Efficiency metric is the measure of the number of assets that are leveraged to build the code. It also takes into account the time taken to run the code.
 An efficient code should take less time to build and is easy to debug. Ultimately an efficient code should be on par with the defined requirements and specifications.

7. Code Analysis: Code quality tools perform static analysis of PHP code, scanning the entire codebase or specific files to identify potential issues. 
They examine the code structure, syntax, and semantics, checking for errors, inconsistencies, and non-compliance with coding standards.


8. Performance Analysis: Some code quality tools analyze the performance aspects of PHP code. 
They identify potential bottlenecks, inefficient algorithms, and resource-heavy operations, enabling developers to optimize the code for better performance.

9. Security Vulnerability Detection: Code quality tools can identify common security vulnerabilities in PHP code, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure data handling. 
By highlighting these vulnerabilities, developers can take appropriate measures to address them and ensure the security of their applications.
